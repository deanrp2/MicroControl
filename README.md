# MircoControl

Repository to house working scripts for optimization problems involving 
HOLOSGen reactor.

DEMO PROBLEMS:
1. Rotate 8 drums in unison to achieve some desired reactivity


NOTES:
* quadrant numbering starts with the top-right quadrant and proceeds
counterclockwise
* drum numbering starts from the bottom drum in  quadrant 1 and
proceeds counterclockwise around each of the drums
* the positive rotation direction is counterclockwise for drums in quadrant 1 and 3
* the positive rotation direction is clockwise for drums in quadrant 2 and 4
